	 * The purpose of this class is to extend the base functionality of FlxSprite so that
	 * sprite sheets with dynamic sizes can be used.  This means instead of a sprite always being
	 * a fixed size, it can now change in size according to what the sprite sheet is.
	 * 
	 * I forsee some interesting and difficult problems implementing this.
	 * Hopefully it will be worth it. :P
